## Make Commands

* `make` will build the full compiler, called `min2mil`
* `make run` will build the compiler and run it in interactive mode
* `make clean` deletes the parser executable and all of the incedental files generated by `flex` and bison`

## Notes 
* Break and Continue statements are not implemented, and will throw a compiler error if encountered. Replace any break or continue statements with another type of statement to ensure that the program compiles
* Output files will always appear in the same directory as the input file, for example, if we run the command `./min2mil tests/test.min`, if the program compiles with no errors, `test.mil` will appear in the `tests/` directory.
