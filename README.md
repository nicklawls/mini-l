## Project Phase 2: Parser

On bell/well, the follwing commands to `make` should work:

* `make all` will build the parser
* `make run` will build the parser and run it in interactive mode
* `make test_[primes|mytest|ifelseif|dowhile]` will run the parser with the associated file as input
* `make clean` deletes the parser executable and all of the incedental files generated by `flex` and `bison`
